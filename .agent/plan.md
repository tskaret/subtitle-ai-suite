# Plan

## 1. Analysis & Verification
- [ ] Read `src/core/speaker_diarization.py` and `src/core/modern_speaker_diarization.py` to understand the difference.
- [ ] Run existing tests to verify current state.
- [ ] Check `requirements.txt` vs code imports.

## 2. Fix Known Issues
- [ ] Add `torchvision` to `requirements.txt` if needed.
- [ ] Investigate and fix SpeechBrain permissions in WSL.

## 3. Implementation / Refactoring
- [ ] Consolidate speaker diarization if needed.
- [ ] Implement missing features from `gameplan.md` (e.g., advanced audio analysis, more formats).

## 4. Final Polish
- [ ] Verify all tests pass.
- [ ] Update documentation.
